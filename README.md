# Simple REST API using Sinatra

Basic  setup for RESTful API using Sinatra light framework.

## Getting Started

This will help setup and install the gems needed and then initiate the server using Shotgun. Shotgun is super helpful with autoloading code changes, which is something that Rack, what Sinatra is built on, does not provide out of the box.

```
bundle install
shotgun 
```
In case you want to specify a port to use: 
```
shotgun -p PORT_NUMBER
```

## Built With

* [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/documentation.html)
* [Bundler](https://bundler.io/v2.0/guides/bundler_2_upgrade.html) - Dependency Management
